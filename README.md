# Magno-Electric Relativity Simulation

_Rewriting the laws of physics through harmonic field dynamics._

![Demo Simulation](outputs/demo_60s.gif)

## Overview
The **Magno-Electric Relativity Simulation** is an experimental physics engine designed to validate the Magno-Electric Harmonic Field Theory — a revolutionary model where magnetism is the primary cosmic generator, with electric fields emerging secondarily, structured by harmonic resonance and sacred geometry.

This project models:
- Harmonic wave interactions
- Nonlinear gain fields
- Field compression and expansion
- Relativistic effects in a magno-electric framework

## Key Features
- **Full field simulation** — visualizes dynamic magno-electric field interactions in real time.
- **Investor-ready visual assets** — includes a 60-second demo GIF for presentations.
- **Configurable parameters** — adjust harmonic constants, wave speeds, and geometry overlays.

## Running the Simulation
Activate your virtual environment, then run:
